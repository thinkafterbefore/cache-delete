This is an action----

This is a fork by [BuildJet for GitHub Actions](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions).
It is **fully compatible with the official setup-node action**, simply replace `actions/setup-node`
with `buildjet/setup-node`.
Under the hood we simply switch the underlying caching package to our fully compatible `buildjet/cache`. No other
changes have been made to this package.

For help migrating to BuildJet's setup-node, please visit
our [migration guide](https://buildjet.com/for-github-actions/docs/guides/migrating-to-buildjet-cache).  
For detailed usage instructions, please visit
the [official `actions/setup-node` repository](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).
